                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Welcome to Quiz Odyssey, where your journey begins with the creation of questions and
                            progresses
                            through exciting stages. Along the way, you'll encounter challenges, chests, and your trusty
                            chatbot NPC to guide and assist you. Your goal is to navigate through the Houses of Wisdom,
                            Mystery, and Strength by answering questions correctly and using special items like Free
                            Passes
                            and Chatbot help to overcome obstacles.</p>

                        <h2>1. Creating Questions</h2>
                        <p>Before you start playing, you need to create at least 8 questions. Each question must be
                            engaging, and you can set the correct answer and provide multiple-choice options. Once your
                            question set is ready, you can proceed to the game.</p>
                        <p><strong>Steps to Create Questions:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Enter the question creation mode</li>
                            <li>Create at least 9 questions</li>
                            <li>Add answers and options for each question (one correct answer and several distractors)
                            </li>
                            <li>Once you've added 9 or more questions, you can begin playing the game!</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>2. The Stages of Quiz Odyssey</h2>
                        <p>There are 3 main stages that you must complete in sequence to advance. You will need to

                            each stage before progressing to the next:</p>

                        <h2>3. Treasure Chests</h2>
                        <p>Throughout the game, you'll come across chests that contain various rewards or challenges.
                            There
                            are two types of chests:</p>

                        <h3>Special Chest (Free Pass)</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Reward:</strong> A Free Pass that allows you to skip one question if you're
                                stuck
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>How to Use:</strong> Once you get a Free Pass, you can use it during any stage
                                if
                                you're struggling with a question. Simply use the Free Pass option to skip that question
                                and
                                continue your journey</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Other Chests (Disappointing Rewards)</h3>
                        <p>Sometimes, you'll open a chest and get a disappointing reward. These chests have humorous or
                            cheeky messages like:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"Better luck next time!"</li>
                            <li>"Oops, no luck today!"</li>
                            <li>"Looks like a dud!"</li>
                            <li>"No luck, sorry!"</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It's all part of the game, so don't be discouraged! Keep trying and moving forward.</p>
